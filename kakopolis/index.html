A museum curator in the titular ancient city, Pauline is surrounded by evidence that the world is the responsibility of mythological figures whose sole aim is to make life terrible. Though seemingly everyone in the city is ready for an apocalypse, Pauline's expertise and frustration, along with an antiquated note left with a local courier, may be able to help break Kakopolis out of its dark era before tensions turn fears into reality.</p><p> </p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p> © GOATZINES 2025</p></div></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://goats.cafe/assets/js/jquery-3.2.1.slim.min.js?v=5f48fc77cac90c4778fa24ec9c57f37d"></script><script defer="defer" src="https://goats.cafe/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=5977caa3bd6c30eab5c559ded3288d58"></script></body></html>
