I'm an artist, writer, and sucker for good stories. I've been drawing for as long as I can remember. It's my first and longest love, <em>long </em>before I had my first computer (let alone internet access); exposure (and addiction) to sites like deviantART and tumblr did nothing to stifle that spark. </p><p>GOATS.CAFE is my personal website; I'd call it an online business card, but that's lame as hell because I'm not a business.<br>I'm a human person with a pen that makes lines happen, and this is my little corner of the internet.
